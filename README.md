# __‚òÅÔ∏è AI-Powered Cloud Security Monitoring Using Microsoft Azure__
This project implements an intelligent, scalable cloud security monitoring system using Microsoft Azure services and Django web application.
It automates real-time threat detection, incident response, and visualization ‚Äî combining Cloud Computing with AI-powered analytics for modern security needs.

# üìú Project Overview
As cloud adoption grows, so do security risks like unauthorized access, data breaches, and suspicious user activity.
This project addresses the challenge by building a modular, scalable, and AI-integrated security monitoring system.

Using Azure Sentinel, Azure Monitor, Event Hub, and Logic Apps, we built an automated pipeline to:

‚Ä¢ __Collecting and centralizing logs__

‚Ä¢ __Detecting real-time anomalies__

‚Ä¢ __Automating responses to security threats__


All using Microsoft Azure's ecosystem and AI-powered analytics.
